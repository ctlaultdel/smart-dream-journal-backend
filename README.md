# Smart Dream Journal 😴
Ada AC2 Capstone Project

## Project Description 🚀

The problem I want to address with my capstone project is providing an easy, efficient tool that allows people to learn about their health by understanding their dream patterns. Hormonal changes can affect when you dream, what you dream about, and sometimes dreaming can even negatively impact your quality of life. For example, night terrors, sleep paralysis, nightmares. For others, dreams can provide inspiration for new ideas and motivation to achieve certain goals in life. I want to create a platform that is convenient for both types of users and will do all the work in identifying patterns, extracting and presenting useful information, and creating a good experience through an asthetically-pleasing interface that makes tracking dreams fun.
